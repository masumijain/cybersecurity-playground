# Burp Suite Lab Documentation

**Name:** Masumi Jain

**Lab Topic:** HTTP Traffic Interception and Parameter Manipulation using Burp Suite

**Date:** 01/02/2026

---

## Objective

* Understand how Burp Suite intercepts web traffic
* Analyze HTTP requests and responses
* Modify GET parameters using Repeater
* Observe server behavior after parameter tampering
* Learn how input manipulation affects backend responses

---

## Lab Environment

**Tool Used:** Burp Suite Community Edition
**Platform:** Kali Linux (VM Environment)
**Browser:** Burp Built-in Browser
**Network Type:** Controlled Lab Environment
**Target:** Authorized testing website inside lab

---

## Step-by-Step Lab Procedure

### 1. Launching Burp Suite

Started Burp Suite in Kali Linux:

```bash
burpsuite
```

* Selected **Temporary Project**
* Used **Burp Defaults**
* Started Burp Suite

---

### 2. Configuring Browser

* Used Burp’s built-in browser to automatically route traffic through proxy
* Enabled interception:

```
Proxy → Intercept → Intercept is ON
```

---

### 3. Capturing HTTP Request

* Visited test URL using Burp browser
* Captured GET request in Proxy

Example captured request:

```http
GET /success?ipv4 HTTP/1.1
Host: target-site.com
```

Observed request headers and structure.

---

### 4. Sending Request to Repeater

* Right-clicked captured request
* Selected **Send to Repeater**
* Navigated to Repeater tab

---

### 5. Parameter Manipulation

Original request:

```http
GET /success?ipv4 HTTP/1.1
```

Modified request:

```http
GET /success?ipv4=1 HTTP/1.1
```

Tested multiple values:

```http
ipv4=127.0.0.1
ipv4=8.8.8.8
ipv4=999.999.999.999
ipv4=' OR 1=1 --
```

Clicked **Send** after each modification and observed server response.

## Commands / Features Used

* Proxy Interception
* Repeater Tool
* GET Parameter Editing
* Response Analysis

---

## Key Observations

* Parameter initially had no value
* Adding value changed server behavior
* Response body and content length varied based on input
* Invalid input tested server validation behavior
* Demonstrated how user-controlled input influences backend processing

---

## Key Takeaways

* Burp Suite is essential for web application testing
* GET parameters can be manually modified to test application behavior
* Repeater allows controlled testing without resending from browser
* Input validation is critical to prevent vulnerabilities
* Even small parameters may affect backend logic

---

## Challenges Faced

* Understanding where to modify parameters
* Differentiating headers from parameters
* Identifying which part of request controls response

---

## Lessons Learned

* Understanding HTTP request structure is crucial
* Parameter manipulation is foundational in web security testing
* Response comparison helps identify potential weaknesses
* Testing must always be performed in authorized environments

---

## Ethical Statement

All testing was conducted in a controlled lab environment.
No unauthorized systems were targeted.
This activity was performed strictly for educational and cybersecurity learning purposes.

---

## Conclusion

Successfully captured and modified HTTP requests using Burp Suite.
Gained practical experience in parameter tampering and response analysis.
Strengthened foundational skills in web application security testing.
